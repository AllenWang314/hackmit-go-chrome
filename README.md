# HackMIT Go Chrome Extension Adopted for Allen's Personal Usage

A Chrome extension for https://go.allenwang314.com/

Just type `go something` in the omnibar...

The extension also finds all instances of "go/whatever", even on Google Docs
and stuff, and automatically turns them into clickable links!
